## About Myself:
 I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. 
I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better.
I am results-oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team.
